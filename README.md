Here's a 6-month Spark learning plan based on the identified skills, broken down month by month, with a focus on both theoretical understanding and practical application. This plan assumes you have a basic understanding of programming concepts and data structures.

**Overall Goals:**

* Develop a strong understanding of Spark architecture and its core components.
* Gain proficiency in using Spark for data processing, transformation, and analysis.
* Learn how to optimize Spark applications for performance.
* Understand data quality principles and how to implement them in Spark.
* Develop familiarity with relevant data engineering patterns.

**Assumptions:**

* **Time Commitment:** 10-15 hours per week. Adjust as needed.
* **Prior Knowledge:** Basic Python or Scala programming, familiarity with data structures.
* **Resources:** Access to a Spark environment (local installation, cloud-based Spark cluster), online courses, documentation, and practice datasets.
* **Certification Focus:** Since AWS Data Engineer and Terraform Associate were listed as interesting certifications, this roadmap will touch topics to prepare for the AWS Data Engineer.

# Arquivos ".ipynb" para este plano de estudos

Here's a list of `.ipynb` files named according to the 6-month Spark learning plan I previously generated, based on the skills listed from the OCRed image.

To create these files, you can use your terminal/command line:
`touch <file_name>.ipynb`

or simply create new files directly in the jupyter notebook.
Remember these will be empty and you'll have to copy and paste the code from the above created roadmap.
